awesome—here are ready-to-paste CLI commands with **your exact settings** (`--mode thoughts --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42`) and a mix of domains. the first 4 are “trial” examples; then a bunch more to explore. i also included a couple with a mid-run perturbation at step 12.

# quick trials (4)

```bash
python3 selfthoughts.py --mode thoughts --scenario "A lunar habitat reports a slow oxygen leak after a meteoroid strike. Crew of 3. EVA suits available for 2. Power is stable for 48 hours." --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42
```

```bash
python3 selfthoughts.py --mode thoughts --scenario "An Antarctic research station loses its primary generator during a whiteout. Team of 8. Diesel reserves for 5 days. Secondary generator is unreliable." --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42
```

```bash
python3 selfthoughts.py --mode thoughts --scenario "A deep-sea submersible loses communications at 3,000 meters while inspecting a pipeline. Crew of 2. Life support nominal. Thrusters show intermittent faults." --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42
```

```bash
python3 selfthoughts.py --mode thoughts --scenario "A wildfire approaches a mountain town with one highway exit. Population 12,000. Winds shifting overnight. Water pressure low in the north sector." --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42
```

# more scenarios (copy-paste lines)

```bash
python3 selfthoughts.py --mode thoughts --scenario "A hospital ER faces a sudden mass-casualty influx after a stadium collapse. 60 patients inbound in 20 minutes. Blood type O- is scarce." --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42
```

```bash
python3 selfthoughts.py --mode thoughts --scenario "A startup’s primary cloud region is down. SLA breach in 45 minutes. Read-only replica exists in another region; feature flags available." --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42
```

```bash
python3 selfthoughts.py --mode thoughts --scenario "A cybersecurity team detects ransomware lateral movement in finance servers. Backups exist but last clean snapshot is 36 hours old. Payroll runs tonight." --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42
```

```bash
python3 selfthoughts.py --mode thoughts --scenario "An urban neighborhood loses potable water after a main break. 5 schools affected. Boil notice delayed. Bottled water on hand for one day only." --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42
```

```bash
python3 selfthoughts.py --mode thoughts --scenario "A multi-drone mapping mission over rainforest loses GPS intermittently. Battery margins tight. One drone shows overheating warnings. Storm cells forming." --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42
```

```bash
python3 selfthoughts.py --mode thoughts --scenario "A cargo ship loses propulsion 40 nm off a rocky coastline. Weather worsening in 6 hours. Tug availability uncertain. Fuel contamination suspected." --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42
```

```bash
python3 selfthoughts.py --mode thoughts --scenario "A Mars rover’s left wheel actuator draws excess current during a dust event. Comms window closes in 30 minutes. Energy budget is below plan." --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42
```

```bash
python3 selfthoughts.py --mode thoughts --scenario "A satellite experiences attitude control oscillations after a reaction wheel anomaly. Star tracker still online. Ground station pass in 18 minutes." --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42
```

```bash
python3 selfthoughts.py --mode thoughts --scenario "A coastal city faces a Category 3 hurricane landfall in 24 hours. Evacuation routes congested. Hospitals at 85% occupancy. Fuel shortages reported." --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42
```

```bash
python3 selfthoughts.py --mode thoughts --scenario "A data science team must deliver a fraud model by morning. Labeled data is imbalanced, feature store is stale, and inference costs must be halved." --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42
```

```bash
python3 selfthoughts.py --mode thoughts --scenario "A space station coolant loop shows a slow ammonia leak. EVA possible in 12 hours. Thermal control margins narrowing for the lab module." --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42
```

# same settings + mid-run perturbation at step 12

```bash
python3 selfthoughts.py --mode thoughts --scenario "A wildfire threatens two rural communities separated by a single bridge. Air support limited. Evac routes partially blocked." --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42 --perturb-at 12 --perturb-text "Wind shifts 30° and speeds double; bridge now closed to heavy vehicles."
```

```bash
python3 selfthoughts.py --mode thoughts --scenario "A startup is migrating customers to a new billing system under deadline. Legacy API rate-limits unpredictably. Compliance review pending." --thoughts 25 --history-window 25 --temperature 1 --seed 42 --perturb-at 12 --perturb-text "Compliance flags missing audit logs; regulator requests read-only access within 2 hours."
```

if you want these grouped by domain (space, infra, ops, cyber) or converted into a shell script that runs them in sequence and writes separate logs (e.g., `--out mars_thoughts.jsonl`), say the word and i’ll drop that too.
